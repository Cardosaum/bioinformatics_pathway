    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **solid path** for those of you who want to complete a **Bioinformatics** course on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our curriculum, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "To become a bioinformatician, you have to learn quite a lot of science, so be ready for subjects like; Biology, Chemistry, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two interesting links that can make **all** the difference in your journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the \"MIT Challenge\", which consists of learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are **fundamental abilities** to succeed in our journey.\n",

    "## How to use this guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order of the classes\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start the first course, [Introduction to Biology](), when you done with it, start the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the course is not open, do it with the archived resources or wait until next class is open.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to track and show your progress\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).\n",
    "1. Copy [this](https://trello.com/b/yax8Kgnh) board to your personal account. See how to copy a board [here](http://blog.trello.com/you-can-copy-boards-now-finally/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have **labels** to help you have more control through the process. The meaning of each of these labels is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.\n",
    "- `Extra Courses`: cards with that label represent courses that was added by the student.\n",
    "- `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing.\n",
    "- `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student. Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course.\n",
    "- `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum. Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column. You should put the *Course's cards* below its respective *Section's card*.\n",
    "- `Extra Sections`: cards with that label represent sections that was added by the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intention of this board is to provide for our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc. You can change the status of your board to be **public** or **private**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Should I take all courses?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here! Also we highly encourage you to complete more by reading papers and attending research projects after your coursework is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duration of the course\n",
    "\n",
    "It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular Bioinformatics course, but we can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!\n",
    "\n",
    "You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.\n",
    "\n",
    "> See more about \"Commit to a process, not a goal\" [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Based\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in **OSS University**, you do **not** need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **real project** or write **papers and publish them** about your focus with Bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"What does it mean?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "After finish a course, you should think about a **real world problem** that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This part needs upgrade:\n",
    "  - The projects of all students will be listed in [this](https://github.com/open-source-society/help/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) file. Submit your project's information in that file after you conclude it.\n",
    "  - Research focused projects\n",

    "### Be creative!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate **and this is what really matters**!\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips about how you can do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.\n",
    "- **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**We love cooperative work**! Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!\n",

    "\n",
    "These skills mentioned above are the very essential tool set that bioinformatician and computational biologist depends on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "You must share **only** files that you are **allowed** to! **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you signed in the beginning of some courses.\n",
